      "New Delhi: An India-built cryostat base and lower cylinder are ready for installation in the $25 billion International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) that is under construction in France, it was announced on Saturday.ITER -- a project proving that fusion power can be produced sustainably on a commercial scale -- is now 65 per cent ready.The biggest fusion machine in history, counting at least one million pieces of equipment, aims to complete through first plasma in 2025 -- the first stage of operation for ITER as a functional machine.The ITER Organization, together with its Indian domestic agency, will complete a major project milestone on July 23 in completing fabrication of the cryostat base and lower cylinder -- a key component of the world's most complex machine coming up in Saint-Paul-les-Durance, some 35 km north of Aix-en-Provence in southern France.\"The fabrication of this component has been an unprecedented engineering challenge and achievement in terms of both its massive size and its intricate specifications,\" ITER Director-General Bernard Bigot said in a statement.What is fusion? It is the same process producing the Sun's energy that gives Earth its light and warmth.ITER will use hydrogen fusion, controlled by superconducting magnets, to produce massive heat energy without emitting carbon dioxide, meaning it is environment friendly compared to the fossil fuels.The magnets, the largest in the world, control and shape the hydrogen plasma where the hydrogen nuclei are heated and fused at 150 million degrees.The cryostat chamber houses the vacuum vessel and magnets in an ultra-cool, vacuum environment.Manufactured by India, the ITER cryostat is 16,000 cubic meters. Amongst the guests, former Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission of India, Anil Kakodkar, will attend the event.Designed to demonstrate the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion power, ITER will be the world's largest experimental fusion facility.Fusion is the process that powers the sun and the stars: when light atomic nuclei fuse together to form heavier ones, a large amount of energy is released\n"

      "Moscow: India and the US have emerged as the topmost respondents to Airbus' quantum computing challenge designed to invite proposals for bringing flight physics into the quantum era, the French aircraft major's head of central research and technology Thierry Botter said.Speaking to IANS on Wednesday on the sidelines of the International Conference of Quantum Technologies (ICQT) 2019 here organised by the Russian Quantum Centre (RQC), Botter said the purpose of the challenge is to assess the new quantum computational technologies for addressing aerospace flight physics problems.Senior executives of the largest IT and hi-tech global companies, including Google, IBM, Microsoft and Airbus, and leading quantum physicists from over 20 countries have gathered at the ICQT 2019 to discuss the prospects of quantum technologies development. The unit, or \"bit\" in regular computing, becomes \"qubit\" in quantum theory, which can be either 0 or 1, or in superposition of them both at the same time.This means that where a normal computer makes calculations sequentially, one at a time, a quantum computer would be able to process information simultaneously, thus making it much more powerful.Commercial production of quantum computers that would process information much faster than today's supercomputers is still some time away -- industry has to first solve hardware issues in quantum technology, according to experts here.Botter said the Airbus quantum computing challenge is designed to seek answers to five distinct flight physics problems of aircraft climb optimisation, computational fluid dynamics, wingbox design optimisation, aircraft loading optimisation and quantum neural networks for solving partial differential equations.Till now, quantum technologies have been applied in the production of equipment like lasers, semiconductor devices and magnetic resonance scanners.According to the RQC Chief Executive Ruslan Yunusov, the world is coming closer to the \"state of quantum superposition\", while quantum networks emerged and developed in many countries from Switzerland to China\n",

Trump had accused China of reneging on its commitments when previous talks broke down in May.This time the US leader said Beijing was supposed to start buying US agricultural products but they have shown \"no signs that they are doing so\".\"That is the problem with China, they just don't come through,\" he said on Twitter, hitting an already-tense relationship between the two countries.Analysts said Trump's tweets will do little to ease the already-tense relationship between Washington and Beijing.A commentary in the Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily on Wednesday, while not mentioning Trump by name, complained that as the talks started, \"the drums of some Americans struck again on the side, disturbing the main melody\".-'Showing weakness' -\"Whatever shred of optimism markets had about the ongoing trade negotiations were dealt as a severe blow when President Trump flew off the handle again at China for not buying American agricultural products,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at VM Markets Singapore.\"(The tweets show) Trump seems eager to get a deal, that shows his weakness,\" said Shanghai-based professor Shen Dingli.Days before the Shanghai meeting, Trump threatened to pull recognition of China's developing nation status at the World Trade Organization, which Beijing called \"arrogance\".The kick-starting of trade negotiations are still being seen as positive -- even if little of substance is expected.\"The short duration of the current meeting to me suggests that this is exploratory,\" said J\n",

      " Parents provided their children's birth weight and length, which were used by investigators to calculate a BMI and PI.The group showed that a low PI, where increases in height and weight are out of sync during development, was most associated with an increase in the size of the major pumping chamber of the heart, the left ventricle, which is considered a risk for future cardiovascular disease.Two-dimensional echocardiography was used to noninvasively look at the children's left ventricle for telltale indicators of hypertrophy like thickening of the walls and less blood being pumped out.Then they studied the relationships between birth weight and birth BMI and PI and the structure and function of the left ventricle in the children.Stansfield noted that at the time of this study, about 25 per cent of the adolescents had obesity or were overweight and most were on an upward trajectory with their BMI, which is not good.Children with an upward trajectory had about a 30 per cent likelihood they would become obese compared to those with a downward trajectory, who showed 5 per cent likelihood.There was also about a 40 per cent increase in visceral adiposity, fat around the belly and the organs inside the abdominal cavity, which is considered particularly unhealthy in adolescents with the upward versus downward BMI trajectory.This study found that a low PI had the highest association with risk factors for heart problems, but the more widely used BMI is also a good tool, researchers noted.\"We believe our findings are a call to paediatricians to be even more diligent in measuring and noting birthweight and length parameters,\" Stansfield pointed.This very early measure of height and weight can provide lifelong insight into an individual's risk of heart and other diseases, he added.\n",

A new study highlighted that an infant's birth weight and height together can help in telling doctors if the baby is born with a heightened risk of heart issues later in life.Birthweight, tells about the foetal growth, while height gives a more complete picture of both fetal growth and growth trajectory, said Dr Brian Stansfield, a neonatologist at the Medical College of Georgia. Measures called ponderal index, or PI, as well as the more widely used body mass index, or BMI, which both account for height and weight, are known to provide a more accurate indication of fetal growth and what's ahead for the child.The findings of the study published in the journal 'Early Human Development' indicated that a low PI or low BMI at birth should be considered as a risk that needs attention and intervention.\"When you look at birthweight alone, you are looking at a measure at a single point in time, which is a big problem when it comes to projecting out,\" said Stansfield.It's known that perinatal growth which is affected by numerous factors from genetics to environmental ones like the mother's health and habits like smoking, nutrition, and gestational diabetes, has important implications for heart development, and animal and human studies have associated low birthweight with heart problems and death.For this study, they looked at 379 healthy black and white adolescents aged between14-18\n",

      " Thursday, Aug 01, 2019 | Last Update : 01:12 AM ISTCapping a week of celebrations over the historic Apollo 11 mission, Vice President Mike Pence joined astronaut Buzz Aldrin on Saturday at the launch pad in Florida that sent the moonwalker and his two crew mates to space for humankindâs first steps on the lunar surface 50 years ago.Pence joined NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon behind his fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong, at NASAâs Kennedy Space Center for a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the moon landing that enthralled people around the world in 1969. âIf Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins are not heroes, then there are no heroes,â Pence told a crowd of dozens of space industry executives and NASA staff in the Operations and Checkout building, the 58-foot-tall (18 meters) chamber that once housed the Apollo 11 command module for testing. Aldrin is 89 and Collins 88.âApollo 11 is the only event in the 20th century that stands a chance of being widely remembered in the 30th century,â Pence said.The building is now home to NASAâs Orion crew capsule, the spacecraft designed to carry astronauts back to the moon by 2024 in what Bridenstine calls the Artemis program, named after the Greek goddess and twin sister of Apollo.The capsule on deck for the programâs first operational mission in 2022 was sitting beside the stage.âThe Orion is in the same cell as where Apollo was stacked 50 years ago\n",

      " With the US elections just 15 months away, time is running out although Mr Trump now has reasonable approval ratings. It’s a solid issue abroad that Mr Trump and his advisers are looking towards to cement the outcome of the 2020 election. The decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal of 2015 has given no pluses because the progression towards any decided strategic advantage related to Iran has not been thought through\n",

      " The Buddha described the human mind as being filled with drunken monkeys — jumping around, screeching, chattering, moving endlessly. Use three keys that can help you understand this mind: “To forbid is to attract, to refuse is to invite, to prevent is to tempt.” For instance, you earnestly feel that you don’t want to be angry — but the anger comes like a monkey\n",

      " Greater autonomy and closer links with India were not granted till the Ladakh Buddhist Association organised a non-violent movement — after many frustrating decades, Ladakh was finally offered an Autonomous Hill Development Council as a compromise in 1995. How to sort out the dilemma?Sonam Wangchuk, a Magsaysay awardee and the inspiration for one of the characters of an Aamir Khan movie, The Three Idiots, believes that the solution is to change the pattern of tourism in space and time; he advocates bringing tourism to the villages (space) and the whole year long (time).It may work for a time, though there is no easy solution, whether it is in Ladakh, Uttarakhand or Himachal Pradesh, mass tourism has too many negative aspects.Ladakh has an advantage over other regions — it has a more responsive administration — the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, and with the division status recently granted by the Central government, the region should get better capacity to solve such problems.On the strategic side, though the Fire and Fury Corps of the Indian Army is watching, the enemy is still at the border.The opening of a new landport for trade with China at Demchok or Dumchele could be an important confidence-building measure with China — hopefully, it will be discussed during President Xi Jinping’s visit to India in October.If the political leadership decides so, Demchok or Dumchele could also become a Border Personnel Meeting (BPM) point, where the Indian and Chinese armies meet\n",

      " On July 11, the Supreme Court gave a direction to the Speaker to meet the 10 MLAs by 6 pm that day and take a decision on their resignations, “forthwith or in the course of the remaining part of the day” — but the next day it pressed the pause button, asking the Speaker to refrain from deciding on their resignations for the time being. Subsequently, the court refused to give any direction about holding the confidence vote within a timeframe, but crippled the Speaker by ruling that the rebel MLAs cannot be forced to attend the session\n",

      " In between these two elections, the AAP polled 32.9 per cent of votes and the BJP polled 46.4 per cent of votes when the election for the Lok Sabha was held in 2014. When it contested the Delhi Assembly elections for the first time in 2013, the AAP polled 29.4 per cent votes, giving a tough fight to both the BJP, which polled 33 per cent votes, and the Congress, which polled 24.5 per cent votes\n",

      " Can Imran Khan really trust President Trump as an honest and discerning neutral umpire as, say, US Senator George Mitchell was in settling the Irish dispute with Britain 20 years ago? If Trump had the required credentials, he would not have backed a shady initiative with a fistful of US dollars to quell the Palestinian quest for a non-racial democracy in a shared homeland for Jews and Arabs. The embarrassing offer came from Trump’s scandalously over-invested son-in-law. It would likelier be unacceptable because an opponent he reviled had signed it.And, just as Trump is bent on offering an alternate deal to Iran with a new list of commitments on missile capabilities and political activities in the neighbourhood, Modi too may rehash the old Singh-Musharraf draft.India recently celebrated its soldiers in the Kargil conflict with Pakistan\n",

      " God ordered Muslims to pray at five set times of the day — the five prayer times are determined by the position of the sun, thereby putting the supplicant in close tune with the rhythms of the day — salat al-faj at dawn, before sunrise; salat al-zuhr at midday, after the sun passes its highest; salat al-’asr in the late part of the afternoon; salat al-maghrib just after sunset; and salat al-’ishaween sunset and midnight.The more elaborate determinants of prayer time are: the afternoon prayer occurring when the shadow of an object stretches to twice its height; the evening prayer ending when the last bit of red disappears from the sunset and actually begins at the first ray of dawn, or, as it says in the Quran, “when the white thread of day becomes distinct from the blackness of night”.On Fridays, a congregational prayer (?al?t al- jum?ah) is performed just after noon. It is a touchstone of a Muslim’s commitment to belief in one God, to whom he bows in every prayer.In Islam, prayer is directly to God alone, without any intermediary or intercessor\n",

      " The best way forward would be to take the tests in Belgium and weigh the national security risks against the pricing and the technology before taking a decision.India must not be bullied into accepting the Chinese offer on 5G but there can be no harm in the subject coming up at the informal summit with President Xi. India has to keep in mind the delicate balance between areas of cooperation and the tension points in its China relationship before taking a call on 5G\n"
